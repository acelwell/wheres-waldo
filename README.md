You know the game. If you dont, then the idea is to look for Waldo within an image. Waldo has unique characteristics and many people or objects have very similar features, but there is only one Waldo.
This project utilizes TensorFlow to detect whether Waldo* is in an image because I for sure don't want to look for him.


Images were found and sources from https://github.com/vc1492a/Hey-Waldo, so a thank you to them. Classification for images containing Waldo are also based on how they decided on which images contained Waldo.

*Based on how the images were originally sorted, some images don't acutally have Waldo in them instead having Waldo look alikes.
